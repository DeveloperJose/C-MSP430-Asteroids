# Project 3: LCD Game
## Introduction
Continuing your effort to help ACME Solutions provide Christmas toys, your task is now to develop a game for the LCD screen.  You should utilize the knowledge you have gained working with the buttons and buzzer.  In addition, a series of libraries have been found to assist you in creating your game.

## Requirements
Your game should meet the following minimum criteria:

- dynamically draw and translate shapes across the screen
- handle colissions properly with other shapes and area boundaries
- produce sound in relation to the state of the game
- communicate with the player using text
- implement a state transition in assembly

Don't forget to properly document your source code and how to play the game.

## Grading Criteria
Your lab will be graded based on the level of understanding shown and demonstrated in your game (i.e. the complexity of your game).  The grading will follow a traditional letter grade scale (A, B, C, F).

Consider the requirements of producing a simple game of pong.  You have the following elements:

- an arena to play in
- a ball
- two paddles to smack the ball around
- a score 

And the game usually behaves with the following functionality:

- the ball moves at a velocity and collides with the arena and paddles
- a sound plays when a collision occurs
- a player scores when the ball makes it to the opposite side of the screen
- the score is updated and the game begins again

Developing a pong game with the minimum features (discussed above) will earn you a grade of a C.  

To earn a better grade (for pong), consider the following ideas:

- shapes, colors, speeds and sizes of graphical elements change size in response to player skill
- rendering the game in such a way that moving objects pass through (but don't erase) the score
